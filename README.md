# Portfolio - Oscar Burga

Hi, I'm Oscar Burga, Game Developer and Software Engineer. This is the GitHub repository for my portfolio website, which should also be published to GitHub Pages soon. Thanks for checking me out!

### Website Template Credits

The original website template I used for my portfolio is called 
[Virtual Folio](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page269/virtual-folio).
I made a fair amount of modifications to adjust the template to my information and taste,
but I did not make this from scratch, so please check out the original creator in the link too!

The included license and credit files in this repository 
are the exact same as the original ones that come bundled with the template.
